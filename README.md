# Yelp-camp
A dynamic website made using Node.js



Why I Built YelpCamp:

My decision to embark on the development of YelpCamp was fueled by the desire to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in creating a feature-rich application while addressing real-world challenges, such as user authentication, data persistence, and cloud storage.
